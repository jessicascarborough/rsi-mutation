# rsi-mutation
A repository for cleaning TCC mutational data and creating figure showing association between RSI and gene mutations. 

All necessary code and data (including cleaned, processed data created using 	`clean_data.Rmd`) is included in this repository, therefore, any file can be run. If you wished, however, to perform the analysis in the order of the authors, `clean_data.Rmd` should be run first, followed by `plot_rsi_mutation.Rmd`.
